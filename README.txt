This is a collection of design patterns from the book "Headfirst Design Patterns" by Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Robson. 
I'm following the examples fairly closely here, so it may look like I'm just copying code, but I am indeed writing it out line by line,   
making sure to fully comprehend everything I'm writing. It helps me learn. This way, I can play around with the code myself 
and even expand on it. Reading it in the book isn't enough. It's close, but not enough. 

The Patterns I plan to include in this repository are the following: 
- Strategy Pattern
- Ovserver Pattern 
- Decorator Pattern
- Factory Pattern
- Singleton Pattern 
- Adapter Pattern 
- Composite Pattern
- State Pattern 
- Model/View/Controller Pattern
